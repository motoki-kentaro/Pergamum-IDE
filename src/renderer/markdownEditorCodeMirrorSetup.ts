/**
 * #390: a customized copy of `codemirror`'s own `basicSetup`, with the
 * completion keybindings excluded from the base keymap.
 *
 * `codemirror`'s `basicSetup` (see node_modules/codemirror/dist/index.js)
 * unconditionally spreads `@codemirror/autocomplete`'s `completionKeymap`
 * (which binds `Ctrl-Space` -> `startCompletion`) directly into its own
 * `keymap.of([...])` call. That binding runs at the ordinary keymap
 * precedence, independent of any `autocompletion({defaultKeymap: false})`
 * config passed elsewhere - so with `basicSetup` still in the tree, it is
 * IMPOSSIBLE to guarantee "never preventDefault while an IME composition is
 * in progress" (#390's most important requirement) for Ctrl+Space, because
 * that hard-coded binding always wins whenever our own IME-aware trigger
 * (see glossaryCompletionExtension.ts) declines to handle the key.
 *
 * `basicSetup`'s own doc comment explicitly invites exactly this kind of
 * customization ("once you decide you want to configure your editor more
 * precisely, you take this package's source ... and adjust it as
 * desired") - this is that adjustment. Two changes from the verbatim list:
 *
 * 1. `completionKeymap` is excluded (see above) so
 *    `glossaryCompletionExtension.ts` can own Ctrl-Space exclusively.
 *
 * 2. #424: the `@codemirror/search` panel openers - `Mod-f`
 *    (`openSearchPanel`), `F3` and `Mod-g` (`findNext` / `findPrevious`,
 *    which themselves fall back to `openSearchPanel` when there is no active
 *    query) - are dropped from `searchKeymap`. Pergamum shows its OWN
 *    active-document Find panel above the editor (see
 *    `find/activeFindKeymapExtension.ts`), so the native bottom search panel
 *    must never open from the keyboard. Every unrelated `searchKeymap`
 *    binding is kept: `Mod-d` (selectNextOccurrence), `Mod-Alt-g`
 *    (gotoLine), `Mod-Shift-l` (selectSelectionMatches) and `Escape`
 *    (closeSearchPanel - inert when the panel never opens).
 *
 * 3. #463: `defaultKeymap`'s own `Mod-[` / `Mod-]` (bound to
 *    `@codemirror/commands`' `indentLess` / `indentMore` - a flat,
 *    Markdown-unaware "insert/remove one indent unit on every selected
 *    line") are dropped. ADR-0014 makes `Mod+]` / `Mod+[` the formal
 *    indent / outdent keybinding, but dispatched through a single
 *    Markdown-context-aware command (`indentCommands.ts`'s
 *    `editorIndentKeybindingHandlers`, keys from the catalog), not
 *    CodeMirror's generic one. `Tab` /
 *    `Shift-Tab` are untouched - neither `defaultKeymap` nor this base
 *    setup binds them (no `indentWithTab`), so they keep CodeMirror's own
 *    default of falling through to ordinary focus movement.
