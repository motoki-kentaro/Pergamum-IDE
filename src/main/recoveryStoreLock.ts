/**
 * Phase 6-4-2: the Recovery Store's cross-process ownership lock.
 *
 * The atomic primitive is `mkdir(<Recovery.lock>)` — it succeeds for
 * exactly one caller and throws `EEXIST` for everyone else. The winner
 * writes `owner.json` inside as human-facing diagnostics and holds the
 * directory for the life of the run; on normal shutdown it deletes
 * `owner.json` and `rmdir`s the lock.
 *
 * The default (`staleReclamation` omitted) still does NOTHING on `EEXIST`
 * except report `unavailable`:
 *   - no bounded wait / retry (a later instance is a Recovery non-owner
 *     *immediately*, and stays silent),
 *   - the acquire-failing side deletes NOTHING belonging to the holder.
 *
 * #293: when a `staleReclamation` policy is supplied, an `EEXIST` failure
 * additionally attempts a NARROW, provable reclamation of a lock left
 * behind by a killed owner:
 *   - `mkdir` remains the final ownership primitive — even after stale
 *     detection, ownership is granted only by a fresh `mkdir` this call
 *     wins,
 *   - the stale `Recovery.lock/` is RENAMED aside
 *     (`Recovery.lock.stale-<ts>-<runIdFrag>/`), never deleted, so forensic
 *     traces survive,
 *   - every ambiguous / inconclusive branch refuses and returns
 *     `unavailable` (missing / malformed `owner.json`, an owner that is
 *     alive or whose liveness cannot be proven, a TOCTOU mismatch, an
 *     archive or re-`mkdir` failure),
 *   - it never touches `Recovery.db` / `-wal` / `-shm`,
 *   - it runs at most once per `acquire()` call: no loop, no recursion.
 *
 * Only the Recovery Store's `main` orchestrator uses this.
