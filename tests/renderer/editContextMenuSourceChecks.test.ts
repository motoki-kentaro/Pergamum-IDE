/**
 * CommandPalette.tsx is a deliberate exception to the no-onKeyDown rule
 * below: ArrowUp/ArrowDown/Enter/Escape navigation inside its own,
 * already-focused search input is local widget interaction (Issue #126),
 * not a competing global shortcut system, and it reuses the existing IME
 * composition signal rather than adding new composition tracking.
 *
 * ConfirmDialog.tsx (#182) is the same category of exception: its
 * `onKeyDown` implements Escape-to-cancel and the modal's own Tab focus
 * trap, scoped to the dialog's own subtree while it is open — not a
 * document-level/global shortcut listener, and unrelated to the Markdown
 * editor's native-edit-command delegation this guard otherwise protects.
 *
 * ChoiceDialog.tsx (#192) is the same dialog-local exception: Escape
 * resolves dismissed and Tab stays inside the modal focus trap; it does not
 * implement app/global shortcut suppression.
 *
 * InfoDialog.tsx (#221) is the same dialog-local exception: Escape closes the
 * information modal and Tab stays inside the modal focus trap.
 *
 * DocumentTabBar.tsx (#184) is the same category of exception again: each
 * tab's `onKeyDown` implements Enter/Space activation for its own
 * `role="tab"` element (a `<div>`, not a native `<button>`, since a nested
 * close `<button>` cannot live inside a `<button>`), scoped to that one
 * tab — not a document-level/global shortcut listener.
 *
 * FileExplorer.tsx (#323) is the same category of exception: its
 * `onKeyDown` handlers implement roving-tabindex Arrow navigation and
 * Space multi-selection for the File Explorer's own `role="treeitem"`
 * rows, scoped to the tree while it is focused — a local ARIA tree widget,
 * not a document-level/global shortcut listener, and it never touches the
 * Markdown editor's native-edit-command delegation.
 *
 * GlossaryEntryMetadataFields.tsx (#375, moved out of the since-removed
 * GlossaryEditor.tsx by #573) is the same category again: the per-atom drag
 * handle's `onKeyDown` implements Arrow Up / Down reorder for its own
 * `<button>` while that handle is focused — a keyboard fallback for the D&D
 * reorder, scoped to the handle, not a document-level/global shortcut
 * listener.
 *
 * GlossaryTagManager.tsx (#375) is the same category once more: the per-row
 * tag drag handle's `onKeyDown` implements Arrow Up / Down reorder for its own
 * `<button>` while that handle is focused — the keyboard fallback for the tag
 * sortOrder D&D reorder, scoped to the handle, not a global shortcut listener.
 *
 * GlossaryEntryTagAssignmentEditor.tsx (#375) is the same category again: each
 * tag drag handle's `onKeyDown` is the keyboard fallback for the two-list tag
 * assignment D&D (Arrow Up / Down reorders an assigned tag; Enter / Space
 * assigns an available one), scoped to that handle `<button>`, not a global
 * shortcut listener.
 *
 * DocumentMapSettingsSection.tsx (#375) is the same category once more: the
 * dialogue-pair drag handle's `onKeyDown` is the Arrow Up / Down keyboard
 * fallback for reordering `documentMap.dialogueDelimiterPairs`, scoped to that
 * handle `<button>`, not a global shortcut listener.
 *
 * GlossaryEntryManager.tsx (#375) is the same category once more: the per-row
 * entry drag handle's `onKeyDown` implements Arrow Up / Down reorder for its
 * own `<button>` while focused — the keyboard fallback for the
 * `glossary_entries.sort_order` D&D reorder, not a global shortcut listener.
 *
 * DialogueDelimiterPairsEditor.tsx (#396 Slice 7 Addendum) is the same category:
 * the dialogue-pair drag handle's `onKeyDown` is the Arrow Up / Down keyboard
 * fallback for reordering `documentMap.dialogueDelimiterPairs`, extracted from
 * DocumentMapSettingsSection.tsx, scoped to that handle `<button>`.
 *
 * find/ActiveFindPanel.tsx (#424) is the same category as CommandPalette.tsx:
 * Enter / Shift+Enter (find next / previous), Escape (close), Ctrl+F / Ctrl+H
 * (mode switch) and Ctrl+Space (glossary IntelliSense) inside its OWN,
 * already-focused search `<input>` — local widget interaction for the
 * active-document Find panel, not a competing global shortcut system. It reuses
 * the existing `event.nativeEvent.isComposing` IME signal (no new composition
 * tracking), and the panel is only mounted while open. The Ctrl+F that OPENS
 * the panel is a CodeMirror `EditorView` domEventHandler
 * (find/activeFindKeymapExtension.ts), not an app/global listener either.
 *
 * ActiveFindGlossarySelect.tsx (#424 Slice 6) is the same category: the
 * glossary-search-mode selector's `onKeyDown` is Arrow / Enter / Escape /
 * Backspace / Ctrl+Space for its OWN focused filter `<input>` (a combobox), and
 * it forwards keys it does not own (Ctrl+F / Ctrl+H, Escape-closes-the-panel)
 * back to ActiveFindPanel via `onUnhandledKeyDown`. Same IME guard, mounted
 * only while the panel is open in glossary mode.
 *
 * editorTabShortcuts.ts / App.tsx (#480) is the same category of exception:
 * the Alt+Left / Alt+Right document tab switching shortcut listener, scoped with
 * strict text-input and modal guards.
 *
 * EditorSurface.tsx (#505 Phase 0) is a DIFFERENT category from all of the
 * above: its capture-phase `keydown` listeners on the editor/preview scroll
 * containers never handle, intercept, or execute a shortcut — they only
 * check `event.key` against a fixed scroll-key set (PageUp/PageDown/Home/
 * End/Arrows/Space) to renew the input-based preview<->editor scroll-sync
 * "leader" tracker (a diagnostic-only classification in this phase). They
 * are passive, never call preventDefault/stopPropagation, and cannot
 * compete with or shadow the Command Palette / native-edit-command
 * delegation this guard protects.
 *
 * HeadingLevelPopover.tsx (#529) is the same category as TableSizePopover.tsx:
 * its `onKeyDown` only implements Escape-to-close for its own small anchored
 * popover, scoped to that popover while it is open — not a document-level/
 * global shortcut listener.
 *
 * PreviewRendererDropdown.tsx (#548) is a toolbar-scoped listbox widget. Its
 * `onKeyDown` handles only the dropdown's own Arrow/Home/End/Enter/Escape
 * navigation while the renderer menu is open, and does not implement editor
 * shortcuts or native edit commands.
 *
 * CalloutInsertDropdown.tsx (#570) is the same toolbar-scoped category as
 * PreviewRendererDropdown.tsx: its `onKeyDown` handles only the callout
 * menu's own Arrow/Home/End/Enter/Escape/Tab navigation while it is open.
 *
 * GlossaryDescriptionMetadataPanel.tsx (#574) is the same category: the panel height
 * resize handle's `onKeyDown` implements Arrow Up / Down and Home / End height
 * adjustments for its own `<div role="separator">` while focused — a keyboard
 * fallback for vertical drag resizing, scoped to the handle, not a global
 * shortcut listener.
 *
 * globalKeyboardShortcuts.ts (#541) is the same category as
 * editorTabShortcuts.ts: a small, reusable app-wide shortcut registry
 * (Ctrl+P Preview toggle, with more shortcuts expected to register through
 * it later) that reuses editorTabShortcuts.ts's own `isEditableTextInputTarget`
 * / `isModalOrDialogActive` guards, so every registered shortcut is silent
 * while typing in a text field or while a modal dialog is open — not a
 * competing global shortcut system, and unrelated to the Markdown editor's
 * native-edit-command delegation this guard otherwise protects.
 *
 * KeyboardShortcutCaptureDialog.tsx (#647) is the same category: a dialog-
 * scoped DOM key listener that exists only as the fallback for when the main
 * process cannot swallow keys during shortcut capture (it is removed when the
 * dialog closes); unrelated to the native-edit-command delegation.
 *
 * reloadKeyFallback.ts (#644) is the same category: one bubble-phase window
 * listener that only calls `preventDefault()` on an UNHANDLED reload /
 * forceReload key (never a command, never `stopPropagation()`), so Chromium's
 * reload cannot fire; it is unrelated to the native-edit-command delegation.
 *
 * ApplicationMenuBar.tsx (#663) is the same category: while one of its popups
 * is open, a window-level key listener only dismisses the popup on Escape
 * (removed as soon as the menu closes). It binds no shortcut, runs no command
 * and ignores every other key; keyboard navigation is #665, and shortcuts stay
 * with the native menu backend. Unrelated to the native-edit-command
 * delegation.
 *
 * EditContextMenu.tsx (#685) is the same category: a menu-scoped onKeyDown that
 * only moves focus between its items and closes on Escape / Tab. It binds no
 * shortcut and runs no command itself; the command still goes through the
 * Command Registry and the native-edit delegation.
 *
 * commandKeybindingDispatcher.ts (#693) is the same category as
 * globalKeyboardShortcuts.ts: one capture-phase window listener that runs the
 * effective key of a registered app-scope command that neither a native
 * accelerator nor a dedicated renderer shortcut runs, through the Command
 * Registry (which decides enablement). It names no command and is unrelated to
 * the native-edit-command delegation.
 *
 * UsageTour.tsx (#714) is the same dialog-local exception as ConfirmDialog /
 * InfoDialog: Escape dismisses the tour and Tab stays inside the modal focus
 * trap; it does not implement app/global shortcut suppression.
